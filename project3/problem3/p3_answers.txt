Note: LINDO was used to solve all four parts of Problem 3.

a) As found in lindo_p3a_sol.txt:

da = 0
db = 2
dc = 3
dd = 3
de = 9
df = 6
dg = 8
dh = 9
di = 8
dj = 10
dk = 14
dl = 15
dm = 17


b) The result will be the same, except that dz will be unbounded.  This is shown in lindo_p3b_sol.txt.  It was unnecessary and undesirable to add a constraint for dz, because since there was a path from a to all other vertices, there could be no path from any vertex to z.


c) This problem is essentially a single-source shortest path problem if we simply reverse the direction of each edge but leave its weight the same.  lindo_p3c.ltx shows how this could be represented as a linear program.  In this case, we let dm = 0.  The results were as follows, from lindo_p3c_sol.txt:

da = 17
db = 15
dc = 15
dd = 12
de = 19
df = 11
dg = 14
dh = 14
di = 9
dj = 7
dk = 10
dl = 2
dm = 0


d) This problem could be solved by finding the shortest path to vertex i from each vertex, finding the shortest path from vertex i to each vertex, and then adding each pair together.  To find the shortest path through vertex i from vertex a to vertex d, for example: add the shortest path length from a to i to the shortest path length from i to d.

The results of finding the shortest path from each vertex to i are in the file lindo_p3d2_sol.txt.  The results of finding the shortest path to each vertex from i are in the file lindo_p3d1_sol.txt.

The Python script p3d_sol.py was used to generate the table of sums that can be found in p3d_vertex_to_vertex_table.pdf.
