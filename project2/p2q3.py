# 3. Suppose V = [1, 5, 10, 25, 50]. For each integer value of A in [2010, 2015, 2020, â€¦, 2200]
# determine the number of coins that changegreedy and changedp requires. You can attempt to
# run changeslow however if it takes too long you can select smaller values of A and also run the
# other algorithms on the values. Plot the number of coins as a function of A for each algorithm.
# How do the approaches compare?
